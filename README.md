<p align="center">This project was the second challenge proposed by Rocketseat in the #boraCodar program. I used only HTML and CSS and finished everything in 1 hour.</p>

<h2 align="center">What I Learned</h2>
<p align="center">I had almost no difficulties on this project and I found myself learning more and more about CSS. I understood how to use the "id" attribute and it didn't take me long to get everything in the right place, as it was before. The only thing I couldn't do was add a gif that shows the product in 360 degrees when the user clicks on it's photo.</p>
